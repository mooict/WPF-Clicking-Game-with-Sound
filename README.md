# WPF C# Tutorial â€“ Create a simple clicking game in Visual Studio
Welcome to this new tutorial. In this tutorial we will be making a simple clicking game with WPF and C# inside of Visual Studio. This game will focus on the user clicking lots of circles inside of the canvas. When you click on a circle it will make a pop sound and disappear from the game and new ones will come out. Each time a new circle will spawn inside of the canvas it will start to grow slowly and when it gets bigger it pop on its own while making a pop sound. The idea behind this clicking game is to click and pop as many circles as possible before the health runs out. Each time a circle pops on its own it will reduce the in game health and when it reaches 0 a message box will pop up to tell you that the game has ended, you click OK on the message box to play again and it save your last score and display it on the screen while you are playing so you can aim to beat that score again on in the game.
